# react-hooks
Create a simple application to test the hooks' concept of react.

In order to try the new concept of hooks, I tried to create a simple application which give a random `addition operation`
then a user enter a result, if it's correct a modal with success message will be displayed.
Unless a wrong message will be shown.

To realize this app, I used also `math-js`, it's a math library for javascript and nodejs. It contains a lot of functions which you to
combine mathematical operations to your code.

For more information about this package, just click on this link:

# To run the example, you have to run:
```
npm install

```

Then:
```
npm run start:dev

```
At the time of writing this app, react hooks are not officially implemented in the stable version of react, So I used an `alpha`version.
